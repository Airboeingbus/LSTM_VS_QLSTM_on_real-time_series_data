# LSTM_VS_QLSTM_on_real-time_series_data
Implementation of a Quantum-enhanced LSTM (QLSTM) for sequence classification. Classical LSTM gates are replaced with variational quantum circuits using PennyLane. Evaluated on binary classification with metrics like accuracy, F1, and confusion matrix for analysis.
